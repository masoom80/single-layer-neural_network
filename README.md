# This home  work consists of 3 parts:\n
1. In the first part we should train a neural network using correlation learning rule for 3 alphabets (A ,B ,C).
2. In this part we should first use pseudo inverse method to directly solve a regression problem and then compare it with result came from the RASNAC method.
3. Lastly we should solve a classification problem using perceptron method.
